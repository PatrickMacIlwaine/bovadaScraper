This project is about beating the gambling websites.

This program scrapes Bovada betting data on Starcraft 2 matches and compares it with Aligulac predictions in order to find beats that are statistically favorable.

The reason I made this program is to better understand how the gambiling websites set their odds. 

The program will output the estimated return for each bet based on Aligulac betting odds. 

TO SCRAPE BOVADA MATCHES: Go to getBovadaBets.py and set url = the page that you want to scape odds from.

TO SCRAPE AND COMPARE STARCRAFT 2 MATCHES TO ALIGULAC: Run main.py
